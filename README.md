Multi-Class Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook source file containing code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**Dataset**
train.xlsx: Training dataset containing features and labels.
test.xlsx: Test dataset for evaluating the trained model.

**Submissions**
sample_submission.xlsx: Sample submission file.
submission.xlsx: Submission file.
submission01.xlsx: Additional submission file.
submission02.xlsx: Another submission file.

**Additional Files**
Test Data.txt: Text document containing test data.
screen shot: A screenshot file showing a visualization or result of the project.

**Usage**
Ensure Python and required libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn) are installed.
